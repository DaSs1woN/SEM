# SEM
Calibrate thousands of atomic peaks in high-resolution electron microscope pictures

TWO PARTs of My work
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Created window sliding technique to make more than 40,000 sample atomic images and non-atomic images

2.Constructed and trained the CNN network based on LeNet-5 Architecture for efficient detection of atomic features in ploy-atomic SEM images operating TensorFlow
